#Go for Gold
A competitive approach to everyday activities!

## Promo
Do you feel like you're always playing frisbee by yourself? Is the rat race keeping you from getting exercise?

That ends today!

Meet Go for Gold!, a more competitive approach to activities that would otherwise just be 'fun'. Now you can guilt your friends into joining you for any activity you choose! Want to play soccer on Saturday? Create a group with your friends, add an activity, and watch as Jim (who would rather 'take care of his kid') is outranked by everyone else in your social circle! He'll feel so bad about not coming to your fifth ultimate frisbee session that he'll be there next time, no matter the consequences.

## Features
- Responsive to phone, tablet, or PC: guilt on the go!
- Create a group and ask your friends to join to start tracking your badges!
- Your rank is sorted against others in your group (whoever has the most badges wins)
- Not sure where Location X is? Google maps will tell you!

## Setup

If you want to get the demo up and running, you'll need to take the following steps:
- Create the database with the following commands:
```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:populate
```
- Run shotgun in your terminal
```
shotgun
```
- Load your localhost and port in the url with the admin user
```
http://localhost:3000/admin/1
*you can change users to 2, 3, 4*
```
- Enjoy!
